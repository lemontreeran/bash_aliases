# A collection of `.bash_aliases` templates

This is GitHub’s collection of [`.bash_aliases`][man] file templates.
We use this list to populate the `.bash_aliases` template choosers available
in the GitHub.com interface when creating new repositories and files.

## Contributing workflow

Here’s how we suggest you go about proposing a change to this project:

1. [Fork this project][fork] to your account.
2. [Create a branch][branch] for the change you intend to make.
3. Make your changes to your fork.
4. [Send a pull request][pr] from your fork’s branch to our `master` branch.

Using the web-based interface to make changes is fine too, and will help you
by automatically forking the project and prompting to send a pull request too.
